# Implementation

This program logs in to my Github account using a read-only token, and prints some information about the user and repositories.
The program is written in kotlin, and uses the Github Java API library

####Commit structure

This repo was originally copied from my LCA repo, and carried over the old commits. This was done to bring over the basic project structure and boilerplate.
